# Couples Journal

A simple journaling app for couples to share their messages of love. This is my first Raspberry Pi project in that
this app will be served from a Raspberry Pi for my wife and I to share endearing messages between each other.

The technology stack chosen:

- .NET 5
- Blazor (Server)
- Entity Framework Core (SQLite)

## Requirements

The requirements are very simple so that the project will actually succeed.

- User accounts (provided by the Individual Accounts option when creating the project, SQLite instead of MSLocalDB)
- As a user I should be able to login and submit a new journal entry. 
- As a user I should be able to view my journal entries as well as my partners in a list with newest first
- As a user I should be able to edit my journal entries
- As a user I should be able to reply to a journal entries written by my partner
- As a user I should be able to delete a journal entry that I wrote
- As a user I should be able to delete a reply that I wrote
